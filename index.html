<p>The final petrol-powered Lotus launches this year <u>2022</u>.
But it promises to send pistons out with, well, a bang.
The <big>Emira</big> is a supercar lookalike for sports car money,
and is off to a flier by being so much prettier
than Porsche’s ageing <big>Cayman</big>.
Then there are the powertrain choices:
first up a supercharged <u>V6 manual</u>,
to be followed by an AMG-spec <u>four-cylinder turbo</u>.
</p>
<p>Lotus is on course for a massive 2022,
with the new Emira being bolstered by
the delivery of the <u>Evija electric hypercar</u> 
and progress being made on the company’s
first foray into crossover SUVs. 
If it can turn the family Lotus into
a cash-printer like <big>Lamborghini</big> did with the Urus,
the future of one of the all-time great British car marques could be secure at last.
